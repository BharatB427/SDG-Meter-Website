# SDG-Meter-Website
***
UI to find similarities with UN's SDG goal and your TEXT.

## Website 
The website was designed with respect to UNEP's official site i.e unep.org 
and similar color scheming was chosen. The template layout was taken from 
bootstrap and assets like images and gifs were, again taken from UN's website. 

## Info
HTML (The page is loaded as index.html)
CSS (We have 2 CSS files, styles.css for the overall styling of the page and circular.css for the styling of a circular progress bar.)
JavaScript (Scripts.js to store JavaScript code)

## Server
A python server runs BERT algorithm to find the similarities and sends the response back to the website,
JS is then used to dynamically generate the content.

## Tools
